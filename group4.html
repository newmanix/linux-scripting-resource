				<h2 class="title">Work of Group 4: Lamp Stack Deployment</h2>
				<div class="entry">
					<p>So you’re setting up a server for your website and you’ve decided to go with the LAMP stack. 
					This requires installing Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL…, but you just don’t have a lot of time. 
                                        Sure would be nice if there was a way to automate the process, kind of do it all in one step!</p>
                    
                    <p>Ok, some of you may be new to this and wondering “What is the LAMP stack?” Let’s start with a “stack” which is 
			simply a group of applications or programs placed on a server to support websites. These programs work together 
			and support the various pieces of the website. The LAMP stack, as you may have guessed, includes the abovementioned 
			programs: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl (depends which of the three you choose to work with.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Here’s a really easy to understand definition* of LAMP stack: LAMP stack is a popular open source web platform 
			commonly used to run dynamic web sites and servers. It includes Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl 
			and is considered by many the platform of choice for development and deployment of high performance web 
			applications which require a solid and reliable foundation. It’s important to note the piece about it being 
			open source, because who doesn’t like free, especially when you’re starting out?!</p>
                    <p>*found at <a href="https://www.turnkeylinux.org/lampstack">Turnkey Linux</a></p>
                    
                    <p>Now that we’ve got the basics out of the way, let’s dig into the How-To of installing this stack in one easy step. 
			First, you will need to have root privileges on your virtual private server (VPS). It will probably be running 
			Ubuntu already, but if not you’ll want to install that first.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Lamp Stack Deployment Code Snippets</h2>
                
				
				<div class="entry">
                <h3>Here are snip-its of the code you will use to execute installing the LAMP stack and what steps they fulfill.</h3>
                    
                    
                    <p>Copy the lamp.sh file to the current working directory. After you have copied the file you will need to allow 
			scripts to run on your machine.</p>

                    <pre>chmod +x lamp.sh </pre>

                    <p>Once you have enabled scripts to run on your machine you will need start running the script.</p>

                    <pre>sudo ./lamp.sh </pre>

                    <p>Let's examine the script to see what it does. After the echo statements we update all the 
			repositories on the machine.</p>

                    <pre>sudo apt-get update </pre>

                    <p>Then we proceed to install the Apache server on the local machine.</p>

                    <pre>sudo apt-get -y install apache2 </pre>

                    <p>Now need set the root password for MySQL; using debconf we will set the root password to MYPASSWORD123.</p>

                    <pre>sudo debconf-set-selections  'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password MYPASSWORD123'</pre>
                    <pre>sudo debconf-set-selections  'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password MYPASSWORD123' </pre>

                    <p>Having set the root password we can now install MySQL Server.</p>

                    <pre>sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server mysql-client </pre>

                    <p>Finally, we are going to install PHP7.0 with MySQL, Curl, Json and CGI configured along with Apache2.</p>

                    <pre>sudo apt-get -y install php7.0-mysql php7.0-curl php7.0-json php7.0-cgi php7.0 libapache2-mod-php7 </pre>

                    <p>The last thing we need to do is restart the system and verify it works:</p>

                    <pre>sudo systemctl restart apache2 </pre>
